My Hospitality Revenue Project: 
Unpacking Hotel Performance in India

Hey there! I worked on a cool data project looking into hotel bookings across four big Indian cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore. 
My main goal was to figure out how much revenue hotels were making, breaking it down by different room types (from comfy premium rooms to super luxurious suites), 
and seeing how successful bookings stacked up against cancellations over a three-month period.

What I Aimed For:
Crunching the numbers to see the total money hotels brought in each week.

Figuring out which room types were the real money-makers.

Understanding how cancelled bookings affected the bottom line.

Ultimately, giving hotels some smart ideas to boost their earnings.

How I Did It:
I used Power BI to bring all the booking data to life. I cleaned everything up, did the calculations, and then built some interactive dashboards. 
This let me see the revenue trends week by week and compare how different room types and cities were performing.

What I Found:
The analysis gave me some awesome insights! I could see exactly how much revenue was generated overall, spot the weekly ups and downs, and pinpoint which room types were pulling in the most cash. 
I also got a clear picture of how many bookings were successful versus cancelled, and which cities had higher cancellation rates. For example, 
I could see revenue jump during certain weeks, probably due to local events, and identify the room types that were consistently top earners.

Why It Matters:
This project offers super valuable insights for anyone in hotel management. 
It helps them make smarter decisions about pricing, fine-tune their marketing efforts, run things more efficiently, and find new ways to grow their business. 
It's all about using data to make hotels even better!
